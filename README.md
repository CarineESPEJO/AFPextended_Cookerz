# AFPextended_Cookerz
Project for an iOS (Swift) application for the Apple Extended Formation program at Simplon in February-March 2025. It was made in 2 weeks. It's not a finished application, but rather a functional model "proof of concept"(POC). In it, I was labeled as Carine ESPEJO. It’s worth noting that our group was new to both coding and Swift/SwiftUI. We had only the standard  AFP and two weeks of training prior to this project, which were divided between project planning, mockups, UX/UI design because some did'nt see that during the standard AFP and a little of more complexe Swift bases like API call. So there is some functions not made and probably some issues or forgotten elements. I couldn't correct and continue this project since we made it.

Cookerz is an interactive app designed to enhance the joy of cooking at all skill levels. Whether you’re looking for simplicity or want to challenge yourself, our app allows you to easily find recipes based on a variety of criteria. For those who crave something new, you can dive into cooking challenges and earn coupons for your favorite boutiques or even books to expand your culinary knowledge.
You can also share your own recipes or post pictures of your latest meals for others to admire. If you're ready to take your cooking skills further, you can join live sessions to learn new techniques alongside other users in real-time. And when you feel confident enough to take the next step, you can host your very own live cooking session.

You can find my name in all the files where I contributed significantly or wrote substantial portions of code. For clarity, here is a list of the main tasks I was responsible for during this project:
- Create a font extension file to implement and manage custom fonts.
- Design and create the data models and set up the initial database structure.
- Act as the central integration point by collecting and assembling all code on my machine (as requested by our teachers, we did not use GitHub).
- code the common pages :
    - the pages showing recipe or cooking classe infos
    - the pages to let the users create recipes or cooking classes

I put comments on each of my code. If you new to swift, it better to begin with login in the cinemates project, in it I try to explain what is each line. On the other files, I just explain what the line (or a group of) serves to do.
