For personnal reasons, I came late in the conception part of this project, most of the drafts were already done, but you can see anyways my small contribution (in purple), The ones on the page final are cleaned version to go with the general style of the app, they were made by half of the squad when the other half (where I was) was creating the data base and POO of the app.
